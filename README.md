# Graduate works
This thesis project aims to demonstrate the seamless assembly and deployment of a React + NodeJS application interacting with PostgreSQL. Leveraging Terraform on AWS, a network infrastructure was configured, comprising two EC2 instances designated for Jenkins Master and Jenkins Agent. Additionally, Security Groups were established to secure the instances. The project includes the development of a Jenkins Pipeline, orchestrating the build and deployment processes of the application into a K8s minikube cluster.
# Infrastructure
The Terraform script included in this project sets up the following infrastructure components:

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
EC2 instances for Jenkins Master and Jenkins Agent
Security Groups to control inbound and outbound traffic for the EC2 instances
# Application Stack
The web application is developed using React and Node.js, providing a modern and scalable architecture. It communicates with a PostgreSQL database for data storage and retrieval.
