This thesis project aims to demonstrate the seamless assembly and deployment of a React + NodeJS application interacting with PostgreSQL. Leveraging Terraform on AWS, a network infrastructure was configured, comprising two EC2 instances designated for Jenkins Master and Jenkins Agent. Additionally, Security Groups were established to secure the instances. The project includes the development of a Jenkins Pipeline, orchestrating the build and deployment processes of the application into a K8s minikube cluster.
